# Netflix-Clone

### I develop Netflix Clone App using Swift UIKit without storyboard as a programmatically. I presented the data I pulled from the TMDB api to the user using Collectionview and TableView. The application shows the user new, trending and upcoming movies and series. The user can search for movies and series, watch the trailer or save it to the download list.

## Technologies
